# 🌍 Global Inflation Analysis – Power BI Dashboard (1980–2024)

An interactive visual story of global inflation dynamics, built with DAX, precision, and purpose.

## 📘 Project Overview

This is my Power BI dashboard project focused on analyzing **global inflation** trends from 1980 to 2024 across countries and regions.

I initially developed it as part of a **virtual internship at The SmartBridge**, but later rebuilt it from scratch to reflect what I would deliver in a **real-world data analytics role** — complete with optimized visuals, DAX-driven KPIs, region-based insights, and compelling storytelling.

Through this dashboard, I aim to answer:

> 📌 Where is inflation rising fastest?  
> 📌 Which regions contribute most to global inflation?  
> 📌 What do the trends reveal globally?
